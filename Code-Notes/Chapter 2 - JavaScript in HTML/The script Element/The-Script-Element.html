        The primary method of inserting JavaScript into an HTML page is via the <script> element.
        This element was created by Netscape and first implemented in Netscape Navigator 2. It was later
        added to the formal HTML specification. There are six attributes for the <script> element:

        ➤➤ async—Optional. Indicates that the script should begin downloading immediately
        but should not prevent other actions on the page such as downloading resources or
        waiting for other scripts to load. Valid only for external script files.

        ➤➤ charset—Optional. The character set of the code specified using the src attribute.
        This attribute is rarely used because most browsers don’t honor its value.

        ➤➤ crossorigin—Optional. Configures the CORS settings for the associated request; by
        default, CORS is not used at all. crossorigin="anonymous" will configure the request
        for the file to not have the credentials flag set. crossorigin="use-credentials" will
        set the credentials flag, meaning the outgoing request will include credentials.
        
        ➤➤ defer—Optional. Indicates that the execution of the script can safely be deferred until after
        the document’s content has been completely parsed and displayed. Valid only for external
        scripts. Internet Explorer 7 and earlier also allow for inline scripts.

        ➤➤ integrity—Optional. Allows for verification of Subresource Integrity (SRI) by checking
        the retrieved resource against a provided cryptographic signature. If the signature of the
        retrieved resource does not match that specified by this attribute, the page will error and the
        script will not execute. This is useful for ensuring that a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
        is not serving malicious payloads.

        ➤➤ language—Deprecated. Originally indicated the scripting language being used by the code
        block (such as "JavaScript", "JavaScript1.2", or "VBScript"). Most browsers ignore this
        attribute; it should not be used.

        ➤➤ src—Optional. Indicates an external file that contains code to be executed.

        ➤➤ type—Optional. Replaces language; indicates the content type (also called MIME type)
        of the scripting language being used by the code block. Traditionally, this value has always
        been "text/javascript", though both "text/javascript" and "text/ecmascript" are
        deprecated. JavaScript files are typically served with the "application/x-javascript"
        MIME type even though setting this in the type attribute may cause the script to be
        ignored. Other values that work in non–Internet Explorer browsers are "application/
        javascript" and "application/ecmascript". If the value is module, the code is treated as
        an ES6 module and only then is eligible to use the import and export keywords.

            Tag Placement

            Traditionally, all <script> elements were placed within the <head> element on a page
            The main purpose of this format was to keep external file references, both CSS files and JavaScript
            files, in the same area. However, including all JavaScript files in the <head> of a document means that
            all of the JavaScript code must be downloaded, parsed, and interpreted before the page begins rendering
            (rendering begins when the browser receives the opening <body> tag). For pages that require a lot
            of JavaScript code, this can cause a noticeable delay in page rendering, during which time the browser
            will be completely blank. For this reason, modern web applications typically include all JavaScript
            references in the <body> element, after the page content, as shown here.
